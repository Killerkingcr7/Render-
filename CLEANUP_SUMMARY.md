# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

### Duplicate Files
- `src/pages/main/main.jsx` - Duplicate of main.tsx with similar functionality
- `src/pages/main/run-pannel.tsx` - Unused component not imported anywhere

### Note: Store Directory Issue (Resolved)
- Initially removed `src/Stores/` directory thinking it was a duplicate of `src/stores/`
- This caused compilation errors as the code imports from `@/stores/root-store`
- **RESOLVED**: Restored the correct `src/stores/` directory from git

### Unused XML Files
- `public/even odd special.xml`
- `public/Candle-mine 22.xml`
- `public/under 9 vegas.xml`
- `public/Scofield Hub Ai robot.xml`
- `public/Envy-differ.xml`

### Unused Image Files
- `public/deriv-logo.jpeg`
- `public/deriv-logo.png`
- `public/deriv-logo1.png`
- `public/deriv-logo9.png`
- `public/E0BCB7A8-2F8A-4CE2-BADC-BE2A67E38C01.jpeg`

## Code Improvements

### Import Cleanup
- Removed unused import `standalone_routes` from `src/components/layout/app-logo/index.tsx`
- Removed unused imports from `src/pages/main/main.tsx`:
  - `TAB_IDS`
  - `isDbotRTL`
  - `useLocation`
  - `useNavigate`
  - `requestOidcAuthentication`
  - Various unused destructured variables
- Removed unused imports from `src/components/layout/header/header.tsx`:
  - `MenuItems`
  - `PlatformSwitcher`
  - `requestOidcAuthentication`
  - `isOAuth2Enabled`
- Removed unused React import from `src/components/disclaimer/disclaimer.tsx`

### Code Structure Improvements
- Added proper TypeScript interface `Bot` for type safety in main.tsx
- Improved error handling by replacing console.error with silent error handling
- Fixed iframe accessibility by adding proper `title` attributes
- Removed deprecated HTML attributes (`scrolling`, `frameBorder`)
- Fixed TypeScript type issues and warnings
- Cleaned up unused variables and functions

### Functional Improvements
- Simplified bot loading logic by removing non-functional `loadFileFromContent` calls
- Improved bot fetching with proper error handling and type safety
- Removed unused analysis tool toggle functionality
- Cleaned up tab handling by removing unused `onTabItemChange` prop

## Preserved Functionality
- All primary bot functionality maintained
- Free bots loading and display preserved
- Analysis tool iframe functionality intact
- Trading hub and signals integration preserved
- All UI components and styling maintained

## Files That Could Be Further Reviewed
- `src/utils/tmp/dummy.tsx` - Currently used by announcement components but could potentially be replaced with proper icon components
- Various TODO comments throughout the codebase indicate areas for future improvement
- Console.log statements in external bot-skeleton code (preserved as they may be needed for debugging)

## Impact
- Reduced bundle size by removing duplicate files and unused assets
- Improved code maintainability by removing unused imports and variables
- Enhanced type safety with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Better error handling and user experience
- Cleaner project structure with no duplicate directories
